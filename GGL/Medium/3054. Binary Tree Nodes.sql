Table: Tree

+-------------+------+ 
| Column Name | Type | 
+-------------+------+ 
| N           | int  | 
| P           | int  |
+-------------+------+
N is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row includes N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.
Write a solution to find the node type of the Binary Tree. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: if the node is the root node.
Leaf: if the node is the leaf node.
Inner: if the node is neither root nor leaf node.
Return the result table ordered by node value in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
Example 1:
Input: 
Tree table:
+---+------+
| N | P    | 
+---+------+
| 1 | 2    |
| 3 | 2    | 
| 6 | 8    | 
| 9 | 8    | 
| 2 | 5    | 
| 8 | 5    | 
| 5 | null | 
+---+------+
Output: 
+---+-------+
| N | Type  | 
+---+-------+
| 1 | Leaf  | 
| 2 | Inner |
| 3 | Leaf  |
| 5 | Root  |
| 6 | Leaf  |
| 8 | Inner |
| 9 | Leaf  |    
+---+-------+

Explanation: 
- Node 5 is the root node since it has no parent node.
- Nodes 1, 3, 6, and 9 are leaf nodes because they don't have any child nodes.
- Nodes 2, and 8 are inner nodes as they serve as parents to some of the nodes in the structure.
